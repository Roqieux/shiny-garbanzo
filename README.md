## Phree Philly Phridge

## Description

Phree Philly Phridge is a application that helps our community locate refridgerators in their respective neighborhoods, that contain food that is free for all. The Fridge Project places refrigerators in predominately public spaces where individuals can donate excess food and others can freely take what they need.  It operates on a mutual aid basis, relying on the collective efforts of volunteers and donors to stock the fridge and make it accessible to those facing food insecurity.
